## 📖 Inspiration: The Magic of 'Inkheart'

The idea for DreamWeavers was sparked by the enchanting movie *Inkheart*, where characters could bring stories to life simply by reading them aloud. This project is a tribute to that magical concept.

Just as the 'Silvertongues' in the film could pull characters from books into the real world, DreamWeavers aims to pull personalized stories from the digital world into a child's reality. It's about making storytelling an interactive and immersive experience, where the child is not just a listener, but the hero of their own tale. This app tries to capture a fraction of that magic, using AI to weave words into a unique adventure for every user.

- **Story Library**: Automatically saves generated stories for later viewing.
- **Share & Download**: Share stories on social media or download them as a beautifully formatted PDF.
- **Customizable Experience**: Includes multiple themes (light, dark, fairy) and adjustable font sizes.
- **Fully Responsive**: Designed to work beautifully on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **AI Story Generation**:
  - **Primary**: [GROQ](https://groq.com/) for ultra-fast generation.
  - **Fallback**: [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) (Mistral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1).
- **AI Image Generation**: [Pollinations AI](https://pollinations.ai/)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.x or later recommended)
- A Vercel account for deployment (optional)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Shiyx27/BedTimeStoryTeller.git
    cd BedTimeStoryTeller
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the server directory:**
    The main application logic is inside the `server` directory.
    ```sh
    cd server
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory by copying the example:
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and add your secret API keys:
    ```env
    # Get from https://console.groq.com/
    GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."

    # Get from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
    HF_TOKEN="hf_..."

    # These can usually be left as default
    GROQ_ENDPOINT="https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions"
    HF_ENDPOINT="https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"
    PORT=3000
    NODE_ENV=development
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🚢 Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment with Vercel.

1.  **Push your code to GitHub.**

2.  **Import your project into Vercel.**
    Log in to your Vercel account and create a new project, importing the repository from GitHub.

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    In your Vercel project settings, navigate to **Settings > Environment Variables** and add the same keys and values from your `.env` file (`GROQ_API_KEY`, `HF_TOKEN`). This is a critical step for the deployed app to work.

4.  **Deploy!**
    Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application. Any subsequent pushes to the `main` branch will trigger a new deployment.

Happy Storytelling! ✨


Setup
-----
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the values:

   - `GROQ_API_KEY` — your Groq API key (recommended)
   - `GROQ_ENDPOINT` — usually `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`
   - (optional) `HF_TOKEN` and `HF_ENDPOINT` for Hugging Face fallback
   - `PORT` — port to listen on (defaults to 3000)

2. Install dependencies and start the server:

   ```powershell
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. Open `index.html` from the project root in your browser, or host the client and server together.

Notes
-----
- The server will attempt Groq first (if `GROQ_API_KEY` is set), then Hugging Face if configured, and finally a local fallback story generator so the app remains functional offline.
- Cover images are proxied to Pollinations (no key required).
- For production, host the server on a secure endpoint (HTTPS) and set `SERVER_BASE` in the client if the server origin differs.

Security
--------
- Do not commit `.env` with real keys. Use environment variables on your host (e.g., Vercel/Heroku/Render/AWS) and deploy the server.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If you get CORS errors when serving client from a different origin, either host the client via the same server or set `CORS` appropriately in `index.js`.
